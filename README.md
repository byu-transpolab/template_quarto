# Quarto template

This repository creates a template article that can be converted into a website, an academic article PDF, and a BYU Engineering thesis. This template also implements the workflow presented in my [lab documentation](https://gregmacfarlane.github.io/lab/workflow.html).

To render this document, use the command `quarto render` in your terminal pointed at the working directory.
